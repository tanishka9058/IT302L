		<p>Cup plates are coasters that provide a place to rest a tea cup while 
		space for a light snack. Teacup plates originated in England in the early 1800s 
		and went out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century[1] 
		(Barber puts the peak of popularity in the US at 1840s[2]), with a brief 
		reappearance in the first third of the 20th century as bridge sets.[1] The 
		cup plates were in common use in the United States during the first half 
		of the 19th century, and were a precursor of the very specialized dishes of 
		Victorian era: ice cream sets, berry sets, lemonade sets, etc.[3]</p>
